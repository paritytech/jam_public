# Transactions Rollup Model 
## Moving data out of JAM database


The previous tutorial sections described how to mint tokens and write account balances directly into Jam state.
This is fine as a tutorial to show how to define a service, and how to access Jam storage within it.
This accumulation centric design is very similar to the way ethereum did work at launch, with a single state shared by all peers, 
but it defeats the general Jam design by polluting Jam storage with service specific data.
It is also not very efficient, as each individual balance has to be specifically accessed during accumulation and this does not scale.
Remember, refinement is generally cheap, accumulation is expensive.

So, we prefer to move processing, as much as possible, out of this accumulation process and into refinement, and we will do so by treating balance changes in batches that we can verify in refinement with the aid of proofs and witnesses. Accumulation, then, will have the simple logic of updating the commitment to the resulting state.

This section of the tutorial will illustrate how to implement this model, and serve as an example for more sophisticated use-cases.

## Overview

This tutorial extends previous tutorials (a token ledger storing data during accumulation) with a focus on:
- designing a client external state: accounts are not stored on Jam state, only the state merkle root.
- discussing the costs of such design.
- developing a minimal external client state code example for educational purpose.

This tutorial will not attempt to:
- be secure, we keep skipping signature checks in refinement.
- be optimal, we use a very simple bounded, unoptimal, merkle state and proofs. For real use a proper third party implementation of state and state storage should be used (eg polkadot sdk).
- implement state distribution: each client should synch upon the last state root finalized in Jam state. A disconnected client will lose ability to synch state if work items and work reports get pruned (the Graypaper defines two retention periods: short-lived _auditable bundles_ are kept in the Audit DA store by assurers only until the relevant block is finalized, and a long-lived data lake, where exported segments and their page-proofs can be retained for 28 days or more). Here we do not implement such client, but simply launch all clients from a disk directory where we keep the successive database states stored in files named according to the state's root hash. A single file called `HEAD` keeps track of which is the current state. This enables us to always sync the witness generation with the current valid state, but of course in case we restart the testnet, or deploy a new service the current state will be reset to genesis. At that moment, the image on disk becomes irrelevant and all such files should be deleted, to avoid submitting inconsistent work packages. This persisted state is used both for interaction via the command line and direct connection to an RPC node.
- define proper role for distribution: every client represents a validator with direct access to the Jam datalake and work items. In a real implementation, distribution strategy must fit the usecase.
- show how to handle errors. External clients must handle the failure or success of service processing, but our dummy client implementation will assume success and try to update its state directly when producing the workitem. If the refinement panics, accumulation will not proceed.
- parallelize execution, since our usecase can fail (multiple parallel transaction overspending an account) and handling parallel refinement is rather complex. Even if part of the tutorial (see segments) lay a foundation to try to resolve multiple parallel state transitions, this is too involved for a tutorial. Therefore every state transition must run sequentially, which means every state transition must start from the state of the previous one.  

## Partial state

In this model, the full service state is managed by external clients, not by Jam service storage. Refinement therefore executes against a partial state carried in the Work Item payload.
We call that partial state a Witness. It is the data needed for refinement to replay and verify a proposed state transition against a committed prior root (often called a state proof in other ecosystems).

Important nuance for this implementation: the Witness is built from state accesses performed during transition execution (reads and writes), not only from values that end up modified.

The Jam's service storage maintains a cryptographic commitment to the global state, so accumulation is limited to updating this commitment after refinement confirms the purported state transition is the correct outcome of all the submitted operations, and it is built on the currently stored state.

Note that refinement, by itself, can ascertain validity of operations only in relation to the partial state communicated with them. Where we have several clients, it may happen that one of them submits a partial state that is not in sync with what the others have submitted to the service and so it may happen that a state transition is considered valid in refinement but corresponds to a global state that is no longer up to date. For this reason, accumulation ensures that the state only changes if its current value corresponds to the initial state confirmed by the Witness, that is, the batch of operations was applied to the service's current state.

In summary, clients store and share a common state, then submit state-transition proofs to the service. Refinement validates the transition from the witness data, and accumulation only stores and updates the state commitment.

## External State Representation

The external state is the full client-side database used to process operations and compute state evolution. We keep it intentionally simple for tutorial purposes.

Balances are stored in a fixed-size binary Merkle tree. The address space is bounded to 2^15 leaves; if two different keys map to the same leaf index, this demo implementation fails on collision.

Token IDs are tracked separately (as a list) and hashed together with the balances-tree root to form the overall state root commitment.

In this implementation, the Witness is built from state accesses performed while executing the transition on the client side.
For each balance key that is read or written, the client records:
- the accessed key/value pair (when present), so refinement can reconstruct the touched leaves;
- the sibling hashes along the leaf-to-root path in the balances Merkle tree.

The witness format is therefore access-based (all keys touched by transition logic), not strictly "all keys that ended up changed". In practice this can include values that were only read for validation (for example checking balances before a transfer).

The collected tree hashes are deduplicated by node index before encoding, so overlapping paths do not duplicate the same hash entry. However, this remains a simple tutorial design and does not try to minimize proof size aggressively.

Token IDs are handled separately from balances: the full token-id list is currently included in each witness.

At this point we have described the state model (full external state + partial witness + on-chain commitment). The next sections discuss a different axis: how this same payload is delivered to refinement (directly, via preimage, or via segments).

Full state serializing is done after all state transition (usually done by the command line producing the jam workitme), with no recovery of errors.

Full state deserializing is done on each command call.


## Payload Delivery Modes
(TODO: review whether this is accurate at the moment. We may not have implemented all the options, and we may be able to deliver the payload via extrinsic as well)

Submission mechanism and payload delivery are different concerns:
- submission mechanism: how the request reaches the service (for this tutorial, via submitted Work Items);
- payload delivery mode: where refinement reads the transition payload from (directly in the Work Item, via preimage, or via segments).

The direct mode is the simplest option: a single Work Item carries both operations and witness data. Refinement executes immediately from that payload.

This design simply put a batch of operations in a single work item. Processing of the batch is done in a single refinement call. Then refinement can directly transmit both new and old state root to accumulation which only update this root (if old root matches).

JAM persistence is therefore only:
- a key value for the current state root
- work items shared in the datalake.

## Building and testing

We now describe how to build and use the example code presented in this tutorial

### Example code

The code under the git repository is split between three crates:
- `token-ledger-service-v2`: this implements the Jam service code, namely the refine and accumulation logic. It is largely dependent on the state transition of `token-ledger-state-v2`. Must be compiled in `no_std` mode and pre-compiled to PVM before it can be used.
- `token-ledger-builder-v2`: this implements the client part, including constructing encoded payloads and submitting them to Jam. It depends on the state transition from `token-ledger-state-v2`, but can be run in `std` mode.
- `toker-ledger-state-v2`: library crate implementing the merkle state and state transition logic. This is used both in the service and the builder and so must be compiled in `no_std` mode.

Code running direct workitme is executed when `Mode` enum is set to `Direct`.


### Prepare a workitem payload for refinement
There are two kinds of operations the user can create:
- Mint: creates a single token with a certain balance that is fully assigned to a seed account. The service only tries to transfer balances of tokens previously minted.
- Transfer: send some amount of tokens from a source account to a destination account.

For ease of use, we let the user specify a series of operations in a friendly way by creating Json files with minimum information for each operation, namely: amounts, token Ids and account descriptors. The latter are a seed to specify valid cryptographic account Ids, that can't be easily generated by hand, and free the user from having to generate valid keypairs for the sake of test examples. You can see an example in `token-ledger-builder-v2/example_payloads/unsigned_ops_mixed.json`.

We can't use Json directly as payload, so we encode it first in binary. The encoded payload run contains both the input operations and the state witness necessary for refinement to verify the correctness of the state transition.

1. Create a list of operations without cryptographic material (no signatures nor account IDs): <unsigned_ops.json>
2. From `token-ledger-builder-v2`, ionvert this list to a Json file with full information in Json with 

```
cargo run --bin sign_ops <unsigned_ops.json> <signed_ops.json>
```

3. Transform the list of operations into an encoded payload suitable for submission with
```
cargo run <signed_ops.json> <output_payload>
```

The client can generate several transitions in sequence while keeping consistency across runs: it loads the latest state from disk, applies operations, then persists the resulting state. By default, each run starts from the hash stored in the `HEAD` file (unless a specific head is provided) and builds the next transition on top of that root. The `HEAD` file stores only the latest root hash, while state snapshots are stored in separate files named by their root hash.


### Submit payload to Jam

You can simply use `just` as in previous tutorial but with `token-ledger-service-v2` as service crate, and use the `submit-file` command to submit the file produced (ie <output_payload> )in previous step.

Alternatively, you can also use the builder to connect directly to an RPC node and submit the Work Package without making use of `jamt`.
In this mode, you pass the Json list of files, and not the encoded payload. 
Note: For this tutorial, the builder assumes you are connecting to a testnet in the Tiny configuration. 

1. Compile the service into PVM with, which outputs a compiled `<service.jam>` file:
```
just build-service <service folder>
```

2. Start a testnet and locate a suitable RPC node message similar to 
`node0: 2026-04-06 16:44:45 main INFO polkajam  RPC listening on [::]:19800`
```
just start-testnet
```

3. Deploy the service on the testnet with and copy the resulting service id (ie `94560b8f`)
```
just create-service <service.jam>
```

4. Submit a work item to an RPC node. By default, this tutorial will try to connect to a node on port `19800`. Adjust as needed.
```
cargo run -- --connect-rpc --service 94560b8f <signed_ops.json>
```

## Debugging

As with any code, it is possible the service meets unexpected conditions and fails to compute to the end, for example due to insufficient gas or memory for the whole workload. We can simulate the latter by commenting this line `polkavm_derive::min_stack_size!(32 * 1024);` and trying to submit a single operation.

We will likely find an error, where refinement does not finish and then accumulation panics:
`node4: 2026-04-09 15:57:48 tokio-runtime-worker WARN   #ea10d9a7 [Accumulation]: Work item failed: Panic`

This error is raised while executing the service code inside the PVM, and to obtain detailed logs of that we need to execute the testnet in debug mode. That can be achieved with 
`just start-testnet-debug`, but keep in mind this generates a much bigger amount of logs. You can redirect the ouptut to file for easier analysis with
```
just start-testnet-debug  2>&1 | tee log_file
```

If an error occurs during PVM execution, you will get a message in your logs similar to this one, with an indication of the location of the error, the likely cause and a possible solution.
```
node2: 2026-04-09 16:16:33 tokio-runtime-worker DEBUG polkavm::api    Location: #112765: u64 [sp + 0x28] = a0
node2: 2026-04-09 16:16:33 tokio-runtime-worker DEBUG polkavm::api  Trapped when trying to access address: 0xfefdddc0-0xfefdddc8
node2: 2026-04-09 16:16:33 tokio-runtime-worker DEBUG polkavm::api    Current stack range: 0xfefde000-0xfefe0000
node2: 2026-04-09 16:16:33 tokio-runtime-worker DEBUG polkavm::api    Hint: try increasing your stack size with: 'polkavm_derive::min_stack_size'
```

In this case, we can just increase the available memory. In this case the error was caused by external conditions: there is not necessarily an error in the logic, but the environment (ie memory) constraints forced the program to stop prematurely. For a different case, where the error is caused by bad logic, we could have different error messages. For example, add this bit of code that tries to divide by zero:
```
    info!("=== Dividing by zero to create a panic in service code ===");
    let a = 10;
    let b = get("zero_divisor").unwrap_or(0);
    let c = a / b;
    info!("Result of division: {}", c);
```

On execution, his results in a different message, also with a trap location:
```
node0: 2026-04-09 16:25:06 tokio-runtime-worker INFO   #1d9993d1 === Dividing by zero to create a panic in service code ===
[...]
node0: 2026-04-09 16:25:06 tokio-runtime-worker WARN   #1d9993d1 Panic message: panicked at src/accumulation.rs:34:13:

node0: 2026-04-09 16:25:06 tokio-runtime-worker DEBUG polkavm::api    Location: #37063: trap
```

Here, we get a pointer to the actual line that caused the error, which should put you on the path to the cause.

The logs provide a full trace of the execution. For example, just before this message you could have something like

```

You can also try to compare this trace to the service's disassembled PVM code.
To do that, first locate the `.polkavm` file (TODO: currently, this seems to be exported to a temporary folder in order to create the .jam file, which is then copied to the current working directory. If there is a way to preserve the `.polkavm` file, I still haven't found it out. For now, I modified the builder logs to also copy the .polkavm together with the .jam file) and disassemble it with
```
polkatool disassemble <file.polkavm>
```

Note: by default, the builder removes some debug symbols from the compiled source, which will not be present in the disassembled file. If you want to have these (indicating the function names), build the service before deploying it on the testnet with the environment PVM_BUILDER_STRIP set to 0.

For example, for the above code, we can find the trap occurred in the following function:
```

Debugging the PVM code is complex and way beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you need to debug at this level, be prepared to invest some serious time in understanding the PVM and the various outputs.

# Other modes of operation

TODO: review these modes of operation, check if we really need pre-images. 
Show how to pass data in an extrinsic instead of the payload

## Using a preimage 

This is an experiment to store payload as a preimage, please do not read this as a usecase that make sense, but just as a description about how to add a preimage to service.

Code is run when `Mode` enum is set to `Preimage`.

We do the same as previously but do not write witness into the work item.

Instead we will publish a preimage for the service.

This design is quite bad:
- delay for preimage is rather long and need three calls when a single one was used previously and generally preimage
- preimages are rather expensive and shall not be use for such short duration storage

### Steps

There is two operations: sollicit then publish. Roughly sollicit pay for the preimage and commit to a hash and a lenth of the preimage blob, publish then transmit the preimage to peers.

From `token-ledger-builder-v2`
```
cargo run -- -i ./example_payloads/op_mint.json -o refinement_payload -pi
```

Here `refinement_payload` will be the same file as previously, but will be use as a preimage, not a workitem.
`refinement_payload.prepare` file will also be created, it contais an workitem for the service that sollicit a workitem.

After creating the service we then submit `refinement_payload.prepare` as a workitem.

This when refine does a lookup for the preimage (we couldn’t provide it at this point), but will not find it, then it will pass an item to accumulation.

Accumulation see this item and call `solicite` host function to allow the given preimage (hash and length are used).

Now, we can provide the workimage to jam (just provide command with `refinement_payload` as parameter).

Next we will submit again the workitem `refinement_payload.prepare`, this time (if preimage had time to propagate), the refinement will find the preimage, decode it, obtain witness and operations and then do the same process as in previous example.

## Exporting segment 


This time we will demonstrate storing payload in a segment. The usecase is to delay processing of state transition, but is also largelly artificial, yet using segment to store service data seems a lot more sound than primage.

Code is run when `Mode` enum is set to `Preimage`.


Segments allows use use the witness and operations in later processing without having to attach them against.

It make a lot of sense in large transformation, eg data mining things over multiple workitem (map), export results in segments and finally reduce these segments.

In our case we cannot really map in parallel because then reduce operation can fail and make things rather impractical, so for the demo we only allow sequential state transitions.

Segments are mainly using two api here:
- refinement export: the segment is created and shared, workitem number of exported segment declaration must match 
- refinement import: the segment is read during refinement, the segment definition is attached to workitem and import will just use an index into these declaration.


## Steps


#### exporting segments


A workitem witness will record state transition in the same way as in our "direct" example and produce a similar payload.

Refinement will just export the payload in a segment.

Refinement run as in `Direct` example: validate all operations, but instead of sending directly the result to accumulation, it will store the payload in a segment by using the `export` host function.

Just using `export` will fail into an `ApiResult::StorageFull` error.

The number of Export must be strictly define in workitem `export_count` description.
Therefore builder should update this value.

In attached code we build payload as before with an additional `--segment` parameter.  

Note that if we use a larger number of exports (eg 3 to get margin), then accumulate will also fail with a `BadExports` error.
So we use number of exports 1 here.

Also note that segment size is fix. Here we assume the payload will fit in a single segment. In real world design, one will allow to fill the segment with data to reduce cost.

On the client side, we must track these exported segments.
Here for testing I just use the exported segment number and workpackage hash from the log.

Following accumulation is will track exported segment by hash in a single service storage value. This tracking allows us to invalidate importing unexpected segments, note that it is a bit overkill and single monotonic counter could be enough.

#### Importing segments

After a few segments are buffed, we would want to actually process them and update the root stored by accumulation 

This is done by asking to process again for the segment(s), but do without attached witnesses. Witnesses will just be read from previously exported segments.

We define a special workitem operation to trigger this. 
Refinement will import all declared segment import for the workitem and process them. This time it will send root update to accumulation as in `Direct` example.
The segments infos must be attached to the workitem desscription.

In attached code, the payload do not contain anything dynamic and is always encoded to "0300000000".
The dynamic data is the list of the workitems to process, this list as the `export_count` is always written in the workitem definition.
With a tool I am using to rpc a new item for my node the syntax is :
```
mytool item --import wp:c5d3d11b9163e8f30fb8cb9bb5e06321441dd44686b0983d82d54e297ddb817f:0 97a7303e  0x0300000000
```
With 97a7303e being my service id, 0x03000000 the static workitem payload and import "wp:<work_package_hash>:<segment_index>".


Using segments export and import we manage to buffer some inputs, and delay processing without using very little accumulation storage.

We did not cover the client access to segment.


#### Sidenotes on design

This is largely a demo, and usecase is not so good for the following reason:

- tracking segment in accumulation: the storage in jamt service is way to big. One cound just rely on two monotonic counters for exported segments and processed segments. Then resolve all info from exported segments or even refinement workitem.
The idea is that `export` of segment at service level is already a service trusted operation and `import` from the same service do not strictly need to be validated during accumulation, we only want to avoid double processing. (one would still need to check that exports are done over the right root(s) during accumulation).

- map reduce: the refinement consuming segments is forcing a sequence of segments, so it makes no sense to put the whole witness in segment, only the root change is really needed.
Proper usecase would be on process that refine to smaller exported segment dataset and merge segments through an infaillible refinement processing.

- delay transaction: makes not a lot of sense. Generally data exported in segment should be transformed data, and really make sense when segment get use in a later computation. Here we just directly copy, so one can say that the design is wrong, but it also lay foundation for mork complex state update (one that would require interaction between non sequential segments processing).
